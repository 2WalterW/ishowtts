## Key Findings

### Current Performance Status

1. **RTF Achieved**: 0.168 (mean)
   - 16% better than target (<0.20)
   - 7.8x faster than baseline (RTF 1.32)

2. **Stability Excellent**: ±4.7% variance
   - Well within target (<10%)
   - GPU frequency locking critical

3. **All Optimizations Working**:
   - torch.compile (max-autotune) ✅
   - FP16 automatic mixed precision ✅
   - Reference audio caching ✅
   - CUDA async streams ✅
   - NFE=7 optimization ✅
   - Skip unnecessary spectrograms ✅
   - FP16 consistency through vocoder ✅

### Optimization Opportunities Identified

#### High Priority (If RTF <0.15 Needed)
1. **NFE=6 Testing** - 14% speedup, quality validation needed
2. **Batch Processing** - Better throughput for concurrent requests

#### Medium Priority
1. **Dynamic NFE** - Adapt to audio length
2. **Streaming Inference** - Lower perceived latency
3. **INT8 Quantization** - 1.5-2x speedup, high risk

#### Low Priority
1. **Micro-optimizations** - Pinyin caching, tokenizer optimization
2. **Advanced techniques** - Custom CUDA, model distillation

### Recommendations

**Current Status**: System exceeds all targets
**Recommendation**: Focus on monitoring and stability
**Next Steps**:
1. Daily regression checks
2. Weekly performance validation
3. Monitor production metrics
4. Only optimize further if new requirements emerge

## Critical Maintenance Information

### Daily Tasks (1 min)
```bash
# Check for regressions
/opt/miniforge3/envs/ishowtts/bin/python scripts/detect_regression.py

# Ensure GPU locked (after reboot)
sudo jetson_clocks
```

### Weekly Tasks (5 min)
```bash
# Run comprehensive benchmark
/opt/miniforge3/envs/ishowtts/bin/python scripts/extended_performance_test.py
```

### After System Updates
```bash
# Re-lock GPU
sudo jetson_clocks && sudo nvpmodel -m 0

# Re-apply F5-TTS patches
cd third_party/F5-TTS && git apply ../../.agent/optimizations_2025_09_30.patch

## Performance Comparison

### Historical Progression

| Date | Phase | NFE | RTF | Improvement |
|------|-------|-----|-----|-------------|
| Baseline | - | 32 | 1.320 | - |
| Early Morning | Phase 1 | 8 | 0.278 | 4.7x |
| Midday | Phase 2 | 7 | 0.251 | 5.3x |
| Evening | Phase 3 | 7 | 0.169 | 7.8x |
| **Latest** | **Phase 3+** | **7** | **0.168** | **7.8x** ✅ |

### GPU Lock Impact

| Metric | Without Lock | With Lock | Improvement |
|--------|--------------|-----------|-------------|
| Mean RTF | 0.352 | 0.168 | 2.1x faster |
| Variance | ±16% | ±4.7% | 3.4x more stable |
| Max RTF | 0.420+ | 0.195 | 2.2x better |

**Critical**: GPU frequency lock is non-negotiable for performance stability.

## Lessons Learned

### What Works Extremely Well
1. **torch.compile** - 30-50% speedup, minimal code changes
2. **FP16 AMP** - 30-50% speedup on Tensor Cores
3. **NFE reduction** - Biggest impact (7.8x total)
4. **GPU frequency lock** - Critical for stability
5. **Caching** - Eliminates redundant preprocessing

### What Didn't Work
1. **TensorRT vocoder** - Slower end-to-end despite faster isolated
2. **torch.cuda.empty_cache()** - Adds 2-5% overhead
3. **Over-optimization** - Diminishing returns after core optimizations

### Key Insights
1. **Audio length matters** - Longer audio = better RTF
2. **torch.compile beats TensorRT** for dynamic shapes
3. **Consistency is important** - Avoid FP16↔FP32 conversions
4. **Profiling is essential** - Don't guess, measure
5. **Stability > raw speed** - Consistent performance is critical

## Next Steps for Future Maintainers

### Immediate Actions
1. Continue daily regression checks
2. Monitor weekly performance trends
3. Maintain GPU frequency lock after reboots

### Short-Term (1-2 weeks)
1. Validate NFE=6 quality if further speedup needed
2. Implement batch processing if concurrent load increases
3. Monitor production metrics

### Long-Term (1-3 months)
1. Consider streaming inference for better UX
2. Research INT8 quantization if RTF <0.10 needed
3. Evaluate new optimization opportunities as they emerge

### Don't Do (Not Worth It)
1. ❌ Custom CUDA kernels (too much maintenance)
2. ❌ Model distillation (too risky)
3. ❌ Architecture search (too expensive)
